## Getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

#run_analysis.R

The purpose of this Rscript is to 
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of run_analysis.R is the text file Final_Data_KathrynMcDonald2.txt.

#Code Book

A code book markdown file, CodeBook.md is also included to provide a detailed description of variables and code used to analyze the training and test data sets, to create Final_Data_KathrynMcDonald2.txt.
